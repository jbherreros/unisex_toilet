# Shared unisex toilet
This code simulates the shared unisex toilet problem. There is only one toilet in the fifth floor of a building and has to be shared between ladies and gentlemen. The solution must guarantee that the toilet is just used by one gender at a time and the maximum capacity cannot be excedeed (3 people max).
